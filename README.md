Hello! I'm Dean, often known in the digital world as Loftwah. I bring to the table my experience as a DevOps Engineer, System Administrator, and Network Infrastructure Professional, with a repertoire that includes REST, Docker, Linux, Infrastructure, Troubleshooting, Network Security, DNS, and Cloud Computing. I'm also certified as an AWS Solutions Architect Professional.

While I might not have embarked on formal coding education, my fervor for technology kindled a self-learning journey, making me adept in areas such as AI, AWS, DevOps, DevRel, Ruby, CrabLang, and Terraform. I've been an active hand in open-source projects, notably contributing to Appwrite, EddieHub, BioDrop, NASA, Nocodb, Streamlabs, and WordPress. When it comes to programming, Ruby and Bash are my trusted allies.

In the open-source sphere, I've had the honor of being an ambassador for EddieHub and its project, BioDrop. For those interested in Linux, my book "Linux for Pirates!" seeks to guide newcomers in the tech sphere.

Beyond technology, I express myself as a hip-hop and music producer under the alias, Loftwah The Beatsmiff. I've blessed the music scene with several albums and have had the privilege to collaborate with names like Grind Mode Cypher and OptiMystic MC.

My career canvas isn't limited to the aforementioned. I've served with pride in the Royal Australian Navy and engaged in large-scale projects across sectors including defence, mining, oil and gas, ISPs, and SaaS. This myriad of experiences positions me uniquely, and I'm keen on channeling this knowledge to uplift the education sector.

When I'm not neck-deep in tech or beats, I run a tech-focused YouTube channel, pen down tech articles, and share snippets from my life ‚Äì be it the hurdles of mental health or joyous road trips with my daughter.

Personality-wise, expect to encounter someone confident, friendly, informal, and brimming with optimism. I champion open, asynchronous communication and am a proponent of tech community growth. Voice calls with me might be occasionally punctuated with music pauses!

A tidbit about me - my military stint has been adorned with awards such as the Iraq Medal, the Australian Active Service Medal, and the Australian Defence Medal. I find my productivity peaking in the afternoon and evening hours.

Feel free to delve into my music on platforms like YouTube or peruse through my writings for insights into tech, career narratives, and the latest in the industry. Appreciate the visit! üòé
