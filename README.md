Hi, my name is Dean, but I go by Loftwah online. Although I have worked in tech and IT, I have not received formal training in coding and recently taught myself.

I am passionate about AI, AWS, DevOps, DevRel, Ruby, Rust, and Terraform. In my free time, I enjoy producing hip hop music and spending time with my 11-year-old daughter.

I recently became an ambassador for the popular open source community EddieHub and its project LinkFree (an open source alternative to LinkTree). I also participated in hackathons and co-hosted my first Twitter space, which had over 1300 attendees. I am currently writing a book called "Linux for Pirates!" to help new individuals in the industry get started.

I love everything technology-related and am always open to asynchronous communication. My preferred work hours are in the afternoon and evening, and I may need to pause my music during voice calls. I have contributed to various open source projects, including Appwrite, EddieHub, LinkFree, NASA, Nocodb, Streamlabs, and WordPress. My preferred programming language is Rust (aside from Bash).

With a diverse background, including experiences in the defence force, defence industry, mining, oil and gas, ISPs, and SaaS, I hope to bring valuable experience to the education industry. My DMs are always open, and I look forward to working with everyone here.

I can be described as somebody who is confident, friendly, informal and optimistic. üòé
