# Dean Lofts

Hi, I'm Dean Lofts and I am brilliantly lazy. I also go by [Loftwah The Beatsmiff](https://btsmf.link), and you might remember me from such albums as Salty Waterz, Salty Waterz 2, Day of The Guiding Light, and Such Iz Life.

I can be described as somebody who is confident, friendly, informal and optimistic.
